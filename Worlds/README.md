# D&D Worlds

This is where I get to store my ideas for new and creative worlds that I can use for D&D campaigns. I'm not creative at all, so this is my attempt to learn how to be a little more creative, and stretch the right side of my brain (not correct side, right, as in right and left). Anyways, nobody will probably read this but me and so I don't probably don't have to explain anything lol. 

I'll probably be organizing my worlds with the following template

1. Conflict
2. Threat
3. Causality
    1. Nations
    2. Races
