# Nytherra

Nytherra is a land of sweeping forests, silver rivers, and mountain ranges crowned in eternal snow — a realm of beauty so profound that even the simplest village feels touched by artistry. Its skies once bore a golden radiance, bathing the land in a light that seemed to bless every harvest, every song, every spell. Travelers spoke of it not as sunlight, but as a living aura, a reminder of the order and harmony that bound the world together.

This Golden Age was shepherded by the Radiant Concord, a great order of high elves whose governance balanced wisdom and discipline. They were no utopia — pride and politics remained — yet the land prospered. Roads were safe, borders stable, and even the darkest dungeons seemed quieter under the gilded heavens. For centuries, Nytherra was defined by order, structure, and a belief that its golden sky would never dim.

## The Conflict – The Shatterfall

That certainty ended in a single night. The sky did not darken; it broke. Cracks veined across the heavens like ink spilled through water, the golden canopy bleeding into a creeping stain of violet and black. From these fractures fell sky-shards, crystalline fragments that scorched the land where they struck, carving scars across forests, cities, and seas. Mountains split open, valleys collapsed, and the once-pristine harmony of Nytherra was thrown into disarray.

With the Shatterfall came whispers — faint at first, like stray thoughts brushing against the mind. They spoke in tones just shy of familiar, weaving suggestions and doubts into the minds of mortals. A farmer found himself thinking of betrayal where none existed. A priest wondered aloud if mercy was weakness. Over time, those who gazed too long into the stained sky or touched the shards would find their eyes glaze with a glassy sheen, their voices flatten, their movements stiffen. Eventually, they became no longer themselves at all, but vessels of something else.

## The Threat – The Invasive Will (Whispers)

Now, the greatest danger to Nytherra is not merely the ruined landscape, but the infiltration of thought itself. The whispers do not conquer with armies, but with infection — spreading suspicion, paranoia, and alien ideas that corrupt from within. Friends can no longer be trusted. Leaders may be puppets. A neighbor, a sibling, even a traveling companion may one day awaken with eyes that no longer shine with their own soul.

No one yet knows the true nature of the force behind the whispers. Are they the remnants of some imprisoned god, loosed by the Shatterfall? A chorus of hungering minds beyond the stars? Or is the sky itself alive, and now cracking under its own divine weight? What is certain is this: if the whispers continue to spread, there may soon be no such thing as free will in Nytherra. Every voice, every choice, every dream will belong to the shadow bleeding through the cracks of the heavens.
