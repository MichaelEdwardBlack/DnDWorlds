# Races

## Humans

- **Before:** Adaptable, dominant in many regions.

- **After:** The most vulnerable to the whispers — their ambition and quick tempers make them easy prey. Some have formed Whisperbound enclaves, where whole cities are ruled by those under the Shard’s influence. Others live nomadic, fearful lives, rarely gazing at the skies.

- **Twist:** Distrusted by other races, since humans are seen as the most likely to "turn."


## Elves

### High Elves (the former rulers)

- **Before:** The ruling class of the Golden Age, bearers of the golden order.

- **After:** Broken and scattered, many fell first to the whispers. Those who remain often struggle with guilt or madness. Their golden light now flickers violet in their eyes, betraying possible corruption.

- **Twist:** Some cling to their fallen empire, trying to restore it — others embrace the whispers as "a truer order."

### Wood Elves

- **Before:** Deep forest dwellers in tune with nature.

- **After:** Their forests are corrupted by falling shards, with warped plants and beasts. Some elves learned to weave nature with shard-taint, creating glowing, alien flora that protects them. Others burned their homes and fled underground.

- **Twist:** The forest elves now walk a razor’s edge between druidic protectors and shard-corrupted blightcallers.

### Drow

- **Before:** Shunned as outcasts.

- **After:** The shadows became a shield — drow are naturally resistant to the whispers and thrive in the new world. For the first time in history, surface folk turn to drow for guidance, protection, and leadership.

- **Twist:** Some drow savor this reversal, becoming reluctant heroes. Others see it as a chance for vengeance, ruling surface survivors with cruelty.

## Dwarves

- **Before:** Proud mountainfolk, masters of craft.

- **After:** The dwarves walled themselves underground and built The Skyforge, an artificial dome that mimics the lost golden heavens with molten rivers of light. Their civilization thrives below, but some dwarves who venture above are treated as paranoid isolationists.

- **Twist:** Dwarves debate if they should "seal forever" or return to reclaim the surface — risking whispers’ corruption.

## Halflings

- **Before:** Cheerful agrarians, thriving in meadows and hills.

- **After:** Their sunny fields were the first destroyed by sky shards. Some halflings formed wandering caravan clans that use songs, charms, and rituals to ward off whispers. Others, broken by loss, became cultlike shard-worshippers, convinced the sky speaks truth.

- **Twist:** Halflings are now either beloved bringers of hope or feared as whisper-carriers.

## Orcs & Half-Orcs

- **Before:** Tribal, often feared as raiders.

- **After:** The whispers twisted their ancestral bloodlust into unpredictable visions and compulsions. Some tribes learned to channel these "shard-furies" into battle, becoming feared berserkers. Others view the whispers as a curse to be resisted with iron self-control.

- **Twist:** Many orcs are seen as "canaries in the mine" — if an orc starts whispering, corruption is near.

## Tieflings

- **Before:** Distrusted for their infernal heritage.

- **After:** The whisper-taint rolls off them — their infernal blood shields them. Once shunned, they are now honored as guardians and wardens who walk where others dare not.

- **Twist:** Some tieflings lean into this heroic mantle, while others exploit their immunity to become ruthless opportunists.

## Dragonborn

Before: Proud, noble, clan-driven.

- **After:** The shatterfall warped many dragonborn lineages. Those once tied to gold, silver, and bronze dragons saw their scales dim and fracture with purple-black streaks. Chromatic bloodlines fared better, adapting easily.

- **Twist:** Now dragonborn debate whether to purge their "broken kin" or accept their mutation as a new evolution.

## Gnomes

- **Before:** Inventors, illusionists, tricksters.

- **After:** Many gnomes succumbed quickly to whispers, their curiosity making them vulnerable. Survivors now live in deep burrows, creating devices and illusions to block out the sky. A rare few embrace the whispers, claiming it fuels genius.

- **Twist:** Gnomes are either brilliant anti-whisper engineers… or deranged whisper-mad prophets.

## Other Options (for flavor NPCs or rare PCs)

- **Aasimar:** Once symbols of the golden order, now hunted for their dimmed or "stained" celestial glow. Some believe killing them appeases the sky.

- **Shifters/Tabaxi/Other Beastfolk:** In regions where animals gained speech and intelligence from the shards, beastfolk thrive as mediators between warped beasts and mortals.

- **Goliaths:** High mountain dwellers, exposed constantly to the fractured sky. Many became living conduits of whispers, half-oracles, half-madmen.
