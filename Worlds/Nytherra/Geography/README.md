# Nations - The Warped Realms of Nytherra
## The Hollow Sun ([Dwarves](../Races/README.md#dwarves) & the Deep Sky)

When the golden sky cracked, the [dwarves](../Races/README.md#dwarves) of Stoneharrow abandoned their surface fortresses, retreating deep into the roots of the mountains. There, they constructed the Hollow Sun: an enormous cavern lit by a crafted "sky" of radiant crystals powered by veins of molten ore. This artificial sun burns dimmer than the real one ever did, but the [dwarves](../Races/README.md#dwarves) cling to it fiercely as both survival and defiance.

- **Adaptation:** [Dwarves](../Races/README.md#dwarves) who once prided themselves on forging weapons now focus on engineering light, heat, and enclosed agriculture. Their children grow up never seeing the true heavens, only the crystalline glow of the Hollow Sun.

- **Conflict:** Some [dwarves](../Races/README.md#dwarves) claim that even their crystals are beginning to crack with faint whispers — and that their safe haven may only be a delay of the inevitable.

## The Inkveil Marsh (Corrupted Lowlands)

Where a massive shard fell, rivers flooded with a violet-black ichor, staining entire lowland regions into toxic swamps. These marshes glow faintly with liquid starlight at night, and the whispers are loudest here — almost like the land itself murmurs.

- **Adaptation:** Strange cults have sprung up, declaring the whispers as the "New Voice of the World." They drink shard-tainted water to induce visions, claiming enlightenment while their humanity slips away.

- **Conflict:** Not everyone in the Inkveil is lost. A resistance of survivors fights to rescue kin from cults, but each day it gets harder to tell who is already compromised.

## The Shardspire Plains (Nomads of Glass)

Where shards pierced the ground, spires of reflective crystal jutted skyward, scattering fragments of light into endless kaleidoscopes. The land is beautiful, but treacherous — reflections whisper back at you with voices not your own.

- **Adaptation:** [Human](../Races/README.md#humans) nomads known as the Glassborn have adapted by wearing mirrored masks and avoiding eye contact with the shards. Their oral traditions now include coded chants designed to drown out the whispers, like spiritual "noise-canceling."

- **Conflict:** Outsiders often mistake them for zealots or madmen, when in truth they may be among the few who've developed genuine defenses against the whispers.

## The Lightless Expanse (Fallen Sunlands)

Entire regions that once depended on the golden sky for fertile soil now lie in perpetual twilight. Crops rot, and people starve. [Elves](../Races/README.md#elves) and [halflings](../Races/README.md#halflings), races once tied to sunlight and growth, suffer immensely here, their spirits waning as much as their bodies.

- **Adaptation:** Some fled, becoming refugees. Others turned to desperate bargains — necromancy to preserve their dead crops, blood pacts for warmth, or outright theft from neighbors.

- **Conflict:** Meanwhile, races like [drow](../Races/README.md#drow) and [tieflings](../Races/README.md#tieflings), long scorned for their ties to shadow and infernal heritage, find themselves naturally resistant to the whispers. For the first time in history, they are hailed as protectors and guides through the darkness. This reversal of roles creates both unlikely alliances and simmering resentments.

## The City of Silent Bells (Broken Order)

Once a shining capital of the [Radiant Concord](./Government/Radiant%20Concord.md), the city's spires collapsed when a shard pierced its heart. The bells of its great temples cracked, their tones twisted into endless dissonance. To protect themselves, survivors cast powerful wards of silence around the ruins — no bells ring, no voices carry. The city is eerily still.

- **Adaptation:** The inhabitants, now called the Voiceless, have learned to communicate entirely through gestures, signs, and written glyphs. They believe spoken words are the first to be stolen by the whispers, and silence is purity.

- **Conflict:** Outsiders see them as broken, but the Voiceless insist they are the last truly free people of Nytherra, untainted by invasive thought.

## The Ascended Spire (Worshippers of the Sky Shards)

A towering fragment of the broken sky landed upright, like a colossal needle piercing the land. Entire pilgrimages of shard-worshippers gather here, claiming that the closer you are to the spire, the more clearly you hear "the truth." They believe the Shatterfall was not a curse but an awakening — that the golden age was a prison, and the whispers are liberation.

- **Adaptation:** They reshape their bodies with shard exposure, allowing their minds to be fully overtaken. To them, individuality is weakness; merging with the whispers is strength.

- **Conflict:** Armies march against them, but the shard-worshippers don't fight with weapons — they fight with words, sowing doubt, paranoia, and betrayal until enemies destroy themselves from within.

## The Breach in the Sky (Floating Isles)

Where the largest fracture still lingers, pieces of land were lifted into the air, suspended among the sky's cracks. Entire communities cling to these floating isles, isolated but safe from most shardfall.

- **Adaptation:** Skyfaring peoples use airships, giant birds, or levitation magic to travel between the floating fragments. Some even worship the breach as a literal stairway to the divine.

- **Conflict:** The isles are fragile. If they collapse, entire civilizations will be lost — and the whispers already echo differently here, as though something on the other side of the sky is close enough to touch.
