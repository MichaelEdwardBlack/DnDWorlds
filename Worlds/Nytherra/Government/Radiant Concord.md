# The Radiant Concord (Before the Shatterfall)
### Structure

**Council of Luminaries:**
At its heart, the Concord was led by twelve High Elves, each representing a different domain of governance (War, Law, Harvest, Trade, Magic, Faith, etc.). They were chosen not by bloodline but by ascension trials — tests of wisdom, magical mastery, and devotion to order.

**Radiant Courts:**
Regional governors (often elves, but sometimes other races) enforced the decrees of the Council. These governors reported annually at the Auric Convocation, a massive gathering where disputes were arbitrated.

**The Golden Edicts:**
A set of living laws, inscribed on enchanted crystal tablets. The laws were known to literally shift and rewrite themselves as new precedents were set — a magical bureaucracy that embodied adaptability while still claiming divine legitimacy.

### Philosophy of Rule

The Concord believed in “Harmonia,” the idea that every race, class, and region had a proper place in the grand order of Nytherra. Their governance focused on balance and efficiency:

* [Elves](../Races/README.md#elves) were seen as natural leaders and administrators.

* [Dwarves](../Races/README.md#dwarves) were entrusted with mining, smithing, and infrastructure.

* [Humans](../Races/README.md#humans) were celebrated for their adaptability — filling roles of soldiers, farmers, and merchants.

* [Halflings](../Races/README.md#halflings) were seen as the keepers of hearth and food.

* [Orcs](../Races/README.md#orcs--half-orcs), [Tieflings](../Races/README.md#tieflings), and [Drow](../Races/README.md#drow) were tolerated but relegated to the margins, considered “volatile elements” that required monitoring.

This system kept order but wasn’t truly equal — a structured hierarchy masked as harmony.

### The Golden Age Achievements

- **Auric Roads:** A vast, glowing roadway network lit by enchanted stones, allowing safe travel at night and linking distant cities.

- **The Skyward Bastions:** Floating citadels where the Council of Luminaries convened, visible from nearly every part of the realm, a literal reminder of “higher order.”

- **Harvest Concordance:** Magical rituals synchronized planting cycles across the land, preventing famine for centuries.

- **The Dawnspeakers:** A diplomatic corps trained to resolve disputes between races and kingdoms before they escalated.

- **The Auric Guard:** Elite paladin orders sworn to protect Concord law, clad in golden plate that shimmered even in the darkest night.

### The Cracks in the Golden Light

- **Rigidity:** While efficient, the system left little room for innovation or dissent. A [dwarf](../Races/README.md#dwarves) who wanted to be a diplomat? A tiefling who wanted to be a priest of light? Such deviations were stifled.

- **Complacency:** The people were so accustomed to stability that they ignored the warning signs of celestial unrest.

- **Elven Arrogance:** The [High Elves](../Races/README.md#high-elves-the-former-rulers) truly believed themselves the chosen stewards of Nytherra. Many non-elves harbored quiet resentment at being “second-tier citizens.”

### Why the Shatterfall Was So Devastating

The Concord projected certainty: laws that could not fail, crops that could not wither, leaders who could not fall to corruption.
When the sky fractured and the whispers seeped in, everything the Concord represented — unshakable order, harmony, and divine truth — collapsed instantly.

Some Luminaries vanished overnight. Others were found babbling the whispers’ words. The enchanted tablets of law cracked and rewrote themselves in madness. The floating citadels fell like meteors.

To the common folk, it wasn’t just the end of a government — it was the death of reality as they knew it.
