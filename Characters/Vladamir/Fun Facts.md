# Fun Facts

## Basic
- [ ] "I once reforged a noble’s family sword because its sentimental value outweighed its combat efficiency. He was furious. I was right."

- [x] "I eat purely for sustenance. Taste is irrelevant. However, efficiency is key, so I have perfected the optimal nutrient-dense meal. It is... unappetizing."

- [x] "The first thing I ever enchanted was a hammer. Not to make it stronger, but to return to my hand when thrown. I nearly knocked myself unconscious testing it."

- [x] "I once had a pet. It was a bird. It failed to return when called. I do not have a pet anymore."

- [ ] "I can forge a suit of armor that will withstand a siege, but I cannot for the life of me sew a straight stitch."

- [ ] "I do not believe in luck. I believe in preparation. That being said, I always carry a spare lockpick. And a spare for the spare."
(Shows your strategic foresight and distrust of chance.)

- [ ] "I don’t believe in luck. Only preparation… though I still carry a lucky coin just in case."

- [x] "I once debated the merits of monarchy with a noble for three hours. I won. He does not recall, as he was drunk. But I know."

- [x] "I find armor more honest than people. If it is weak, it breaks. If it is strong, it endures. People should be built the same way."

- [x] "I have already calculated which party member is most likely to betray me first. It’s not personal. It’s just statistics."

- [x] "I once convinced my brother Benito that drinking molten steel would make him stronger. He still can’t taste food properly."

## Development - Early Shift – Learning to Mimic Empathy
- [ ] "I have studied how to give comforting words in difficult situations. The correct response is: ‘That sounds hard. I’m here for you.’ Did I say it right?"

- [ ] "An ally once told me that it is ‘not normal’ to weigh friendships by usefulness. I asked what they weigh them by. They said ‘trust.’ I am still analyzing this answer."

- [ ] "I have noticed that when people trust you, they are less likely to question orders. This is a highly effective strategy. I am becoming… trustworthy."

- [ ] "I now respond to bad news with a sigh, a slight head tilt, and the phrase: ‘That’s unfortunate.’ People seem to appreciate this."

- [ ] "I let an ally win a debate once. I could have dismantled their argument, but they seemed… happier believing they were correct. This is a new strategy I am testing."

- [ ] "I have come to appreciate battle camaraderie. It strengthens loyalty. Also, when people believe you care for them, they protect you more. Efficient."

- [ ] "I have assigned each of my allies an emotional response. When they are distressed, I mimic it accordingly. This appears to be working."

- [ ] "An ally once said, ‘I trust you with my life.’ I found this oddly satisfying. I should encourage more of this behavior."

- [ ] "I have started to refer to my allies as ‘friends.’ The word appears to make them more emotionally attached. I will continue this experiment."


- [ ] Late Game – Feigned Emotional Loyalty Becomes Nearly Indistinguishable from Genuine Bonding

"At first, I viewed emotional bonds as mere tools. But the longer I maintain them, the more… difficult they are to quantify. Is usefulness the only measure of worth? I… need more data."
