    - Tibble’s guilt over brother losing leg to plague.
    - Roark feeling like a coward for running from a fight when he was little (he would have died)
* Party bonds through shared vulnerabilities. Vlad realizes honesty/vulnerability can be a tool for manipulation.

* Teresa arrives at battle’s end: “What’s going on here?”
