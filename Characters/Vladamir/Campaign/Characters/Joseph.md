# Joseph

**Race:** Githyanki

Joseph and [Ekaterina](./Ekaterina.md) met through [Ekaterina](./Ekaterina.md)'s brother Alexander. Alexander and Joseph were friends during the time when the Githyanki were divided on who was the rightful heir to the Githyanki throne, Vlaakith or Orpheus. Vlaakith ended up "winning" and while Joseph was a non believer in Vlaakith's divinity, he still married [Ekaterina](./Ekaterina.md) over an altar for Vlaakith out of respect for her and her beliefs.

Joseph was a renowned blacksmith with shoulders as broad as an anvil.
He believed that only strength gave meaning to life, and the weapons were not just tools but proof of survival. His lessons to Vlad and his brothers were always the same, "the strong bend the weak, or are bent themselves."

[Ekaterina](./Ekaterina.md) was much different, quieter and sharper. She saw value in precision and foresight. She had a gift to spot impurities in ore and flaws in the steel before it shattered under a hammers strike.

While the two were perfect for each other in the forge, their house was unfortunately divided in values and philosophy. Vladimir's brothers took to their father's teachings. [Adolf](./Adolf.md) found the most favor in his father's eyes, with his brutal and cruel methods. Vlad may have been the only one who valued his mother's teachings, especially after being called "reckless" by his father. From then on Vlad would find worth only in "usefulness," not strength, not kindness, just utility
