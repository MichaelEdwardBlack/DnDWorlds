Halfling Druid. Kind-hearted, empathetic, and deeply connected to nature. Her brother was crippled by the plague (lost a leg). Holds guilt over it. Nearly died in the elemental fight. Starting to suspect Vlad, but still has some trust in him.

Contracted a Lycanthropic infection and has turned into a werewolf. The disease is changing her to be more aggressive and cruel. 

She also doesn't believe Vlad can cook, as earlier she did not like his rations at all! But who can blame her?
