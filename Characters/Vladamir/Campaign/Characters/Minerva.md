# Minerva

Type: Ethereal Being / Spirit Guide (exact nature unknown)

First Encounter: On road to Eastwatch, after Hawthorne's destruction

## üß¨ Appearance & Demeanor

* Ethereal, otherworldly presence ‚Äî not fully tied to the material plane.
* Speaks with authority, but always indirectly.
* Appears at crossroads or moments of great choice.
* Comes across as concerned, guiding, but with her own agenda.
## üìú Known Statements & Warnings

* On the Realm's Danger (Eastwatch):
    - Spoke of imbalance caused by plague, famine, bad organization, and the monarchy.
    - Framed current troubles as part of a larger, connected crisis.
* On the West (Maze Entrance):
    - Said she has "no good connection in the West."
    - Admitted she disliked the party's plan to travel westward.
    - Warned that the West's chaos is different than the East's imbalance.
* On Guidance (Maze Entrance):
    - Advised party to take the right fork in the maze.
    - Path was indeed the shortest, but also contained the ice beast combat ‚Äî the only true fight in the maze.
    - Suggests she may be testing the party as much as guiding them.

## üß© Motives (Unclear)

* Appears invested in keeping balance in Thalidor, but her methods are questionable.
* May distrust or even fear whatever powers operate in the West.
* Seems to want the party alive, but not without suffering ‚Äî her "guidance" always has a cost.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Role in Campaign So Far

* Serves as a foil to the monarchy's narrative: where nobles see control through force, Minerva speaks of balance.
* Keeps appearing to the party specifically ‚Üí suggests they are part of her design.
* By guiding them into trials (like the maze), she may be testing their worthiness for a larger role.

## ‚ùì Theories (Vlad's POV)

* Celestial/Planar Agent: A servant of a higher power, watching for imbalance across the continent.
* Manifestation of Balance: Perhaps not a "person" but a force, tethered to the East but cut off from the West.
* Manipulator: Plays at being helpful but is deliberately steering the party into suffering to strengthen or weaken them.
* Potential Ally or Rival: If Vlad can exploit her warnings, he could claim foresight that others lack.

## üé≠ How Vlad Might Use Her

* With Nobles: Quote Minerva's cryptic wisdom to sound prophetic or enlightened.
* With Allies: Cast her warnings as proof that "only Vlad truly understands the bigger picture."
* For Leverage: If she mistrusts the West, Vlad could use that to pit East vs West more effectively.
