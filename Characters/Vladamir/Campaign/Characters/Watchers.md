# Watchers

## Cloaked Figures / Town Destroyers

A group of cloaked figures was seen at the beginning of the campaign. We assume they were the ones who destroyed the town of [Hawthorne](../Geography/Hawthorne.md)

## Shaded figure / Conjurer of elementals

Cloaked being seen summoning elementals in the [water cave](../Geography/Water%20Cave.md). Spoke directly to Tibble, telling her “you won’t be able to save him.” Presumably referring to her brother, though Tibble is evasive about details.

## The Mountain Keep's Masters

The plants told us of a woman who was one of the Masters of the [mountain keep](../Geography/Mountain%20Keep.md). She would come to the keep and dig the 13 child size graves and then refill them, still leaving the graves empty despite being filled with dirt.
