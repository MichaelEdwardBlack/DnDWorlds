    - Tibble baits wolves in sheep form.
    - Party ambushes and wins fight.
    - Roark's compassion saves little girl (transformed wolf) with [clockwork eye](./Items.md#clockwork-eye) rewind.
    - Vlad mishears "capture" as "kill" → accidentally blows up old man.
* Wolves may shift back in daytime; hints of magical control, similar to elementals.

* [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md) arrives at battle's end: "What's going on here?"

## Session 9 - Seaside to Coastal City - Adventures with Percy
* Lycanthropy Conflict
    - [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md) arrives mid-battle, decisive and pragmatic. Orders executions rather than cures
    - Vlad sides with her logic but tries to suggest a more theatrical execution to build fear/control. Teresa declines, preferring efficiency
    - Roark resists Teresa's command, showing his softer side. Carries little girl to Doug's
    - Tibble is bitten -> loses a Sanity point -> begins slow transformation
    - The little girl later betrays Roark (bite attempt). [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md) delivers the final blow, burying her alive
    - [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md), the bullied boy with wolfish traits, saved by Tibble. Shows strong stealth potential
* Political Advancement:
    - Vlad speaks privately with [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md), pitching the "8 champions" idea (her 5 + [Malory](./Characters/Malory.md)'s 3)
    - Tersa likes the framing -> gives Vlad, Roark, and Tibble supplies (3 backpacks, 60 gold, and a [Sending Stone](./Items.md#sending-stone)
* [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md)'s Training:
    - Party begins shaping [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md) into a rogue apprentice. Roark bonds strongly with him
    - Team orchestrates a montage of pickpocketing + distractions -> net 100 gold each to pay the mountain guide
    - Vlad shines with prestidigitatoin (marking targets, fireworks), illusion tricks, and manipulation
    - Roark distracts people and guards by bumping into them and talking with them with his high charisma
    - Tibble causes rain distractions and gust of wind to turn out lights
    - Circus performance was funny as Tibble played the announcer and Vlad played the cat-eating lizard, and Roark played the firebreathing dragon
    - Earned an extra 10 gold each for the circus performance with Roark asking for tips
* The Mountian Guide Revealed:
    - Dawn arrives, the guide shows up...it's Vlad's father, [Joseph](./Characters//Joseph.md), the family blacksmith patriarch
 
## Session 10 - Mountain Pass

* Father & Son Tension:
    - Vlad mocked [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) narrow-mindedness: "How is your strength going to help us through the mountain? You are so narrow minded you can't even see how the royalty chose us as their champions."
    - [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) made his own remarks: "Only the weak flaunt their power. The chosen champions are so reckless they don't even take watches in the night!?"
    - Tibble spoke in Vlad's defense.
    - [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) later called Tibble reckless for traveling with Vlad → Vlad stayed silent, but took psychic damage internally.
* [Minerva](./Characters/Minerva.md)'s Warning:
    - Party encountered Minerva at the start of the maze.
    - She expressed distrust of the West, saying she had "no good connection there."
    - Warned the party that the West's chaos is different from the East's imbalance.
    - Advised them to take the right fork at the maze entrance.
    - Following her advice led to the shortest route — but also to the ice beast fight (the only combat encounter).
* Moments with [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md):
    - [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md) saw snow for the first time, alongside Roark.
    - Thanked Vlad for being "much nicer than [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) and camped next to him.
* Watch & Snow Incident:
    - Roark fell asleep outside in the snow.
    - Vlad lied about keeping watch the whole time, but [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) caught him.
    - Vlad redeemed himself by finding Roark buried in snow.
* The Maze Challenges:
    1. Ice Beast Battle – Roark nearly died; Tibble revived him with Cure Wounds. [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md) thought Roark was dead, but the party persuaded him it was a tactic. Vlad added: "Sometimes you need to know when and how to trick your enemy."
    2. Fear Illusion – Vlad saw his own death (fear of mortality and failure). Roark saw through the illusion and guided the party.
    3. Blood Sacrifice Bowl – Roark cut his hand and bled into the bowl to open the way. DM whispered private consequence to Roark.
* End of Session:
    - [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) awaited them at the exit of the maze to continue the mountain crossing

## Session 11 through 13 - Memories
### Arrival at the Keep
* [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) led the party to a [keep in the mountains](./Geography/Mountain%20Keep.md).
* The group spoke to enchanted plants that said the keep belonged to “the Masters.”
* They found 13 graves the size of children’s graves, but the plants claimed nothing was buried there. A woman comes and digs the holes, then fills them back in. No further details known.
* Roark found a forge and crafted something (a weapon for him or Percy, I can't remember).
* Vlad claimed the largest bedchamber. Behind it, he discovered a hidden room with a magical chessboard and writing desk.
* The chessboard required capturing pieces in a specific order to progress; failing resets the board.
* Vlad failed three times, grew frustrated, and went to bed.

### The Transformation in the Night
* Tibble’s behavior grew increasingly aggressive due to her [lycanthropic infection](Conditions.md#lycanthropy).
* Roark hired the goblin merchant to keep watch during the night.
* Tibble transformed into a werewolf.
* Roark immediately pursued her, while Vlad stayed with Percy, who was terrified.
* Roark successfully dodged her attacks, then cast Command to make her revert and sleep.
* Roark shouted for Vlad to grab the [dream pillow](./Items.md#blue-starry-book).
* Vlad, who had been cooking soup with Percy by the fire, fetched the pillow and entered Tibble’s dream.

### The Dream and the Awakening
* Throughout the transformation, the party received mental flashes of Tibble’s memories — moments of trauma involving her brother and Sweetwater Lake.
* Inside the dream, Vlad found Tibble watching a projector screen showing these memories.
* She was entranced until Vlad broke through, telling her she had become a werewolf and needed to wake up.
* Tibble regained her true self and awoke safely.
* The soup Vlad had cooked without magic was surprisingly good — a symbolic moment showing his growing care for his companions.

### Clash with Joseph
* [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) stormed in angrily, calling Vlad reckless for aligning with his friends.
* Vlad defended his companions, saying that different strengths make a stronger whole, and that their playfulness boosted morale.
* Percy accidentally bumped into [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md), who struck him.
* Vlad froze, haunted by the memory of being struck the same way in his youth.
* Roark verbally defended Percy, while Percy withdrew, shaken.

### Conversation with Percy
* Roark discovered Percy had fleas and helped him clean up with a bath.
* Later, Vlad and Percy talked about morality:
* Percy worried he was “bad” and “deserved” to be hit.
* Vlad explained his utilitarian beliefs, but also admitted that morality can differ between people.
* He told Percy to decide for himself what’s right and wrong — and reassured him he was not a bad person.

### The Watchers’ Game
* Vlad and Roark returned to the magical chessboard and solved it together.
* A journal from the Watchers appeared, describing a chess metaphor about sacrificing pawns to cleanse a corrupted board.
* “The pawns play at being kings, and now the board must be wiped clean.”
* Vlad was deeply intrigued, torn between his utilitarian roots, his growing care for his companions, and the [Watchers’](./Characters/Watchers.md) ruthless ideology.

### The Soup Duel
* In the morning, Tibble doubted that Vlad had made the soup himself, so he vowed to prove it.
* Percy joined in, wanting to cook too.
* Roark announced a cooking competition and volunteered to commentate.
* Vlad cooked perfectly again, while Percy made a meal from trash — something from his childhood.
* Feeling compassion, Vlad used Prestidigitation to make his soup taste worse and Percy’s trash taste better.
* Roark was surprised it didn’t taste horrible.
* Tibble was stubborn but finally admitted Vlad’s soup was good, giving a small smile.
* The party laughed together — a rare moment of warmth.

### Planning to Keep Their Memories
* Knowing [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) would cast a spell to remove their memories before entering the West, the party devised a plan:
* Vlad would create an illusion of a Watcher commanding [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) to let them retain their memories.
* Roark would use Command to reinforce the illusion.
* Tibble would cast Hypnotic Pattern to charm [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) for an advantage.
* Despite the clever setup, [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) saw through it all and mocked Vlad for taking a coward’s path instead of confronting him directly.

### The Fight Against Joseph
Initiative begins.
* Tibble uses Entangle to root Joseph’s battle axe to the ground.
* Vlad upcasts Armor of Agathys and walks straight up to Joseph, saying, “Give me your best shot.”
* Roark’s Command fails.
* Joseph attacks twice and misses. The party mocks him. Tibble quips, “I find stretching helps,” dealing psychic damage.
* Percy darts in, slashes Joseph’s leg, and leaps back.
* Tibble’s Gust of Wind pins Joseph prone.
* Vlad’s Booming Blade misses.
* Roark’s sword connects, doing heavy damage.
* Joseph burns Action Surge for four attacks — two at Vlad, two at Roark.
* Vlad avoids all thanks to Shield and Roark’s Shield of Faith.
* Roark takes several hits.
* Percy slashes again; Tibble misses her Hypnotic Pattern.
* Roark lands Searing Smite, setting Joseph ablaze.
* Joseph strikes Vlad, triggering Armor of Agathys for retaliatory damage.
* Joseph grapples Vlad and begins casting the memory removal spell — but Roark activates his [Clockwork Eye](Items.md#clockwork-eye), reversing time just enough for Vlad to escape.
* Vlad notices the blue light (nat 20 on Perception) and suspects Roark intervened.
* Vlad uses his extra chance to land a Booming Blade — a blow that could have killed Joseph.
* But seeing Joseph’s weakness, Vlad chooses mercy, knocking him unconscious instead.
* The companions cheer, but Vlad feels conflicted.

### The Aftermath
* Vlad leaves a [note](./Note-From-Vlad-To-Joseph.md) in Joseph’s clothes, intending to make amends.
* Then: hands clap in the silence.
* [Minerva](./Characters/Minerva.md) appears, her voice echoing through the hall:
* “Well done. Mind if I join you?”
