## Session 8 – Dream Manipulation & Seaside Town
* Vlad uses [dream-pillow](./Items.md#blue-starry-book) to spy on Roark & Tibble → fails deception, exposed.

    - Tibble baits wolves in sheep form.
    - Party ambushes and wins fight.
    - Roark's compassion saves little girl (transformed wolf) with [clockwork eye](./Items.md#clockwork-eye) rewind.
    - Vlad mishears "capture" as "kill" → accidentally blows up old man.
* Wolves may shift back in daytime; hints of magical control, similar to elementals.

* [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md) arrives at battle's end: "What's going on here?"

## Session 9 - Seaside to Coastal City - Adventures with Percy
* Lycanthropy Conflict
    - [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md) arrives mid-battle, decisive and pragmatic. Orders executions rather than cures
    - Vlad sides with her logic but tries to suggest a more theatrical execution to build fear/control. Teresa declines, preferring efficiency
    - Roark resists Teresa's command, showing his softer side. Carries little girl to Doug's
    - Tibble is bitten -> loses a Sanity point -> begins slow transformation
    - The little girl later betrays Roark (bite attempt). [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md) delivers the final blow, burying her alive
    - [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md), the bullied boy with wolfish traits, saved by Tibble. Shows strong stealth potential
* Political Advancement:
    - Vlad speaks privately with [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md), pitching the "8 champions" idea (her 5 + [Malory](./Characters/Malory.md)'s 3)
    - Tersa likes the framing -> gives Vlad, Roark, and Tibble supplies (3 backpacks, 60 gold, and a [Sending Stone](./Items.md#sending-stone)
* [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md)'s Training:
    - Party begins shaping [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md) into a rogue apprentice. Roark bonds strongly with him
    - Team orchestrates a montage of pickpocketing + distractions -> net 100 gold each to pay the mountain guide
    - Vlad shines with prestidigitatoin (marking targets, fireworks), illusion tricks, and manipulation
    - Roark distracts people and guards by bumping into them and talking with them with his high charisma
    - Tibble causes rain distractions and gust of wind to turn out lights
    - Circus performance was funny as Tibble played the announcer and Vlad played the cat-eating lizard, and Roark played the firebreathing dragon
    - Earned an extra 10 gold each for the circus performance with Roark asking for tips
* The Mountian Guide Revealed:
    - Dawn arrives, the guide shows up...it's Vlad's father, [Joseph](./Characters//Joseph.md), the family blacksmith patriarch
 
## Session 10 - Mountain Pass

* Father & Son Tension:
    - Vlad mocked [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) narrow-mindedness: "How is your strength going to help us through the mountain? You are so narrow minded you can't even see how the royalty chose us as their champions."
    - [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) made his own remarks: "Only the weak flaunt their power. The chosen champions are so reckless they don't even take watches in the night!?"
    - Tibble spoke in Vlad's defense.
    - [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) later called Tibble reckless for traveling with Vlad → Vlad stayed silent, but took psychic damage internally.
* [Minerva](./Characters/Minerva.md)'s Warning:
    - Party encountered Minerva at the start of the maze.
    - She expressed distrust of the West, saying she had "no good connection there."
    - Warned the party that the West's chaos is different from the East's imbalance.
    - Advised them to take the right fork at the maze entrance.
    - Following her advice led to the shortest route — but also to the ice beast fight (the only combat encounter).
* Moments with [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md):
    - [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md) saw snow for the first time, alongside Roark.
    - Thanked Vlad for being "much nicer than [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) and camped next to him.
* Watch & Snow Incident:
    - Roark fell asleep outside in the snow.
    - Vlad lied about keeping watch the whole time, but [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) caught him.
    - Vlad redeemed himself by finding Roark buried in snow.
* The Maze Challenges:
    1. Ice Beast Battle – Roark nearly died; Tibble revived him with Cure Wounds. [Percy](./Characters/Percy.md) thought Roark was dead, but the party persuaded him it was a tactic. Vlad added: "Sometimes you need to know when and how to trick your enemy."
    2. Fear Illusion – Vlad saw his own death (fear of mortality and failure). Roark saw through the illusion and guided the party.
    3. Blood Sacrifice Bowl – Roark cut his hand and bled into the bowl to open the way. DM whispered private consequence to Roark.
* End of Session:
    - [Joseph](./Characters/Joseph.md) awaited them at the exit of the maze to continue the mountain crossing
