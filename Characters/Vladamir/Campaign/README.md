## Session 2 – Return to Hawthorne’s Tragedy

* Party is shrunk to rat-size; aid rat village in fighting cats.
* Vlad acquires [magical dream-pillow](./Items.md#blue-starry-book) (lets him view others’ dreams).
* Forest encounter forces reflection:
    - Vlad recalls father calling him reckless.
    - Tibble’s guilt over brother losing leg to plague.
    - Roark feeling like a coward for running from a fight when he was little (he would have died)
* Party bonds through shared vulnerabilities. Vlad realizes honesty/vulnerability can be a tool for manipulation.

* Discover: [Malory](./Characters/Malory.md) = barbarian, values strength.
* Learn: [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md) = more magical, intellectual type.
* [Malory](./Characters/Malory.md) seems to distrust [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md).

## Session 6 – Cave & Elementals
* Accompany [Malory](./Characters/Malory.md) to water source cave.

* Roark writes to [Camille](./Characters/Camille.md); Vlad writes to [Craig](./Characters/Craig.md) ("I’ll keep the water in the right hands — ours").
* [Shaded figure](./Characters/Unknown.md) reappears, taunts Tibble: "You won’t save him."

## Session 8 – Dream Manipulation & Coastal Town
* Vlad uses [dream-pillow](./Items.md#blue-starry-book) to spy on Roark & Tibble → fails deception, exposed.
    - Roark outs him as manipulative pawnmaster using his [Clockwork Eye](./Items.md#clockwork-eye) given to him by [Minerva](./Characters/Minerva.md).

    - Party ambushes and wins fight.
    - Roark’s compassion saves little girl (transformed wolf) with [clockwork eye](./Items.md#clockwork-eye) rewind.
    - Vlad mishears "capture" as "kill" → accidentally blows up old man.
* Wolves may shift back in daytime; hints of magical control, similar to elementals.
* [Teresa](./Characters/Teresa.md) arrives at battle’s end: "What’s going on here?"
