📝 The Note from Vlad to Joseph

```
(Handwritten in precise, elegant script. Folded once and tucked under Joseph’s gauntlet.)

Father,

You taught me that only the strong survive — that emotion dulls the mind and weakens the hand. I believed you for many years.

But strength without purpose is just cruelty.

I have found companions whose value you would never measure — they are unpredictable, emotional, and often reckless. Yet through them, I have learned that loyalty and compassion can forge stronger steel than fear or pride ever could.

You struck me once to make me strong. You struck Percy for the same reason. But neither of us needed your strength. We needed your trust.

I will not strike you back. Not because I cannot — but because I no longer need to.

When you wake, remember that your son spared you.

— Vladamir

P.S. I will win this game of pawns and kings. Even if I must rewrite the rules.
