# The Mountains

* Location: The great divide between East and West Thalidor.
* Notable Features:
    - Dangerous terrain, with few safe passes.
    - Natural barrier that has kept East and West isolated, culturally and politically.
    - Rarely crossed; most who attempt do not return.
* Significance:
    - Symbol of isolation between the two sides of Thalidor.
    - Party plans to cross soon to reach Tibbleâ€™s hometown, which is surprisingly in the West.
    - Likely a place of trials and strange encounters.
    - Party got a guide (Vlad's father [Joseph](../Characters/Joseph.md)) to guide them across the mountain pass on the condition they lose the memory of their travels -- See [campaign notes](../README.md#session-10---mountain-pass) for details
    - Magical ice barriers and maze in the mountains (probably placed by some entity)
