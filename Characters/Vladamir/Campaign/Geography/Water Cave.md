# Contaminated Water Source (Cave near Malory’s Camp)

* Location: Underground cave system, near [Malory’s](../Characters/Malory.md) encampment in Eastern Thalidor.
* Notable Features:
    - Source of the East’s drinkable water.
    - Dead fish discovered here, likely poisoned or corrupted by magical influence and causing the [bloodless death](../Conditions.md#bloodless-death) that has been reeking havoc in the East.
    - Site of elemental conjuration (earth and water) that merged into a greater elemental.
* Significance:
    - Whoever controls the water controls survival in Eastern Thalidor (Vlad immediately noticed this).
    - Mallory proved her strength here, earning more respect from her troops.
    - The [conjurer’s](../Characters/Unknown.md) involvement suggests the water is being deliberately targeted to destabilize the region.
