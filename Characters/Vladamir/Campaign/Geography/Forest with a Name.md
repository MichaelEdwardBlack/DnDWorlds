# Forest with a Name

* Location: Eastern woodlands, beyond Eastwatch.
* Notable Features:
    - Mystical, dream-like forest. Home to [yellow dream flowers](../Items.md#yellow-dream-flowers) that, when brewed as tea, induce visions and hallucinations.
    - Magical effects within — party was shrunk to rat-size and helped a rat village fight cats.
    - Forest contains connections to dreams and memory, perhaps tied to otherworldly forces.
* Significance:
    - Party gained magical items here:
        * Vlad's [Dream Book/Pillow](../Items.md#blue-starry-book)
        * Roark's [merchant chest](../Items.md#travelling-merchant-chest)
        * Tibble...I can't remember what she got
    - Brought up personal moments of vulnerability (Vlad’s father calling him reckless, Tibble’s guilt about her brother, Roark not being a hero and running instead of fighting).
    - Reinforced bonds between party members, while giving Vlad insight into manipulating them.
