# Mountain Keep

* Location: deep in the mountains that have escaped any cartographers knowledge of its location as it does not appear on the [map of Thalidor](../Government/Thalidor.jpg).
* Notable Features:
    - Home to a magical chess board, a forge, and racists plants, the keep seems to be empty
    - The plants seem to know who the keep belongs to. The plants call the owners "The Masters", or "[The ones who watch](../Characters/Watchers.md)"
    - The curious star like symbol that the travelers have found, has also been spotted in this keep. 
    - 13 child size, but empty, graves filled by a [Woman Watcher](../Characters/Watchers.md#the-mountain-keeps-masters)
* Significance:
    - [Joseph](../Characters/Joseph.md) led the party here to rest after the Maze challenge.
    - The [Watchers](../Characters/Watchers.md) symbol appeared on a journal entry here. The entry talked about a chess metaphor and how the Watchers need to wipe the board clean and start anew.
    - Tibble turned into a werewolf for the first time here
    - Memories of Tibble and her brother were flashed sporatically into the Minds of our champions
    - The watchers don't seem to afraid of people staying in their keep as the deal with the guides that pass through is that the travellers would lose their memeories and thus, keep their secret keep safe.
