## Manticore Sex Tavern

Tavern where travelers who know can pass a secret word to the tavern owner or bartender. The following dawn a hooded guide will meet them in the tavern to guide them across the mountains for a price of 100 gold per person.

Another condition for traversing the mountains is that the travelers memories will be wiped after the journey as a safety measure to protect the guide's identity and any secrets this guild may have with the travel.
