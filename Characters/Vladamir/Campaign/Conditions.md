# Conditions

## The Bloodless Death
### Symptoms & Appearance
* Victims are found drained of vitality, pale and bloodless in appearance.
* Corpses look unnaturally empty — not simply diseased, but as if something has taken the life out of them.
* Distinct from typical famine or plague deaths (not starvation, dehydration, or natural rot).

### Confirmed Facts from the Campaign
First major sighting by Vlad: In Eastwatch, where Craig the healer is working on a cure.

Dead fish were found contaminating a key water source (the same that supplies Eastern Thalidor). This suggests tampering with the water supply, but you already noticed that mere contamination couldn’t cause such an extreme condition.

Elementals (Earth & Water) were conjured at the water source — indicating deliberate sabotage by a conjurer.

The Shaded Figure told Tibble: “You won’t be able to save him.” — seemingly referring to her brother, who lost a leg due to the plague. This suggests the plague may have a personal, magical origin, not just environmental.

Victims are often left in a way that makes healers powerless. Craig struggles to find any cure — hinting this is not a natural disease.

### Theories/Interpretations
Magical Curse or Ritual: Victims look drained, not diseased — possibly their life force is being siphoned or fed to something/someone.

Weaponized Sabotage: The conjured elementals at the water source strongly suggest a deliberate plot to destabilize the East by poisoning its lifeline.

Possibly Linked to Werewolves: The [Seaside](./Geography/Seaside.md)’s wolf-curse may be part of the same network of afflictions. Both involve unnatural transformations/draining tied to magical corruption.

Not Just Waterborne: While dead fish were found, the severity of symptoms suggests the water is one vector among many. Something deeper (necrotic magic, planar influence, or a pact) is driving the Bloodless Death.

### Political Implications - Vlad's Insight
* The monarchy has failed to contain it, proving weakness.
* Whoever controls the cure (or even just the illusion of control) will control the East.
* A utilitarian like Vlad could easily weaponize this:
    - Restrict water supplies to enforce loyalty.
    - Provide selective access to a cure to build a loyal faction.
    - Frame rivals as “failures” for not protecting their people.

## Lycanthropy

* Converts humans or possibly others into wolf-like creatures
* Curse is spread by bites
* After being bitten, the player can lose **sanity** points to basically get advantage on a roll. 
* After losing an unknown amount of **sanity**, the player will completely transform into a lycanthrope.
